By \"linear growth,\" we mean that doubling the investment period would double the account growth.  Exponential is much better than that.  As can be seen from the figure, $1 would grow to slightly more than $3 in 15 years at 8% per year, so the growth in value is slightly more than $2.  Doubling the investment horizon to 30 years increases the growth to $9 (from $1 to $10), so the growth in value is more than four times larger when the horizon doubles, with an 8% return.

Instead, we will compute future value factors by compounding the monthly returns, then multiply the cash flows by the future value factors to compute the future value of each cash flow, and then sum the future values to obtain the ending balance.  The numpy cumprod function is useful for computing the future value factors.  Given an array (a, b, c), the cumprod function returns (a, a\\*b, a\\*b\\*c).  For us, these numbers will be 1+returns, and we want the sequence to be declining in the number of products (all of the returns for the first FV factor, ..., only one return for the last FV factor).  To obtain this, we apply the cumprod function and then flip the result to obtain (a\\*b\\*c, a\\*b, a).^[These are random returns, so it doesn't matter if we compute (a\\*b\\*c, a\\*b, a) or (c\\*b\\*a, c\\*b, c).  If the ordering of the returns mattered and a were the first and c the last, then we would need to reverse the order (by flipping) to obtain (c, b, a) and then apply cumprod and flip  to obtain (c\\*b\\*a, c\\*b, c).]\n",
